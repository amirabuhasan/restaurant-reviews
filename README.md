# Restaurant Reviews Stage 1

## Introduction

This project was built to take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker was also added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

## Instructions

* To run, set up a server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
* Alternatively, a working live link can also be found here: https://amirabuhasan.github.io/restaurant-reviews/
